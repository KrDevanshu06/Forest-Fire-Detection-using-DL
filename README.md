## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning methods to detect forest fires using an end-to-end workflow:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques to prepare and augment sensor and image data.
- **Model Development:** Designing and training a deep learning model to recognize fire patterns.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance with relevant metrics.
- **Deployment Considerations:** Outlining steps for real-time implementation and monitoring.

The primary implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook `Forest_Fire_Detection_using_DL.ipynb`.

## Motivation

Forest fires are a significant environmental and economic concern. Early detection is critical to minimize damage and enable rapid response. This project aims to harness deep learning's power to create an efficient, scalable, and accurate detection system that can be integrated with real-time monitoring systems.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Prepares and normalizes both image and sensor datasets.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Implements a neural network tailored for fire detection.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and plots to visualize data distribution, model training progress, and performance metrics.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to integrate additional data sources or modify the model architecture.

## Technologies

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch:** Deep learning frameworks (adjust according to your implementation).
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and presentation.
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib:** For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For additional machine learning utilities and evaluation.
